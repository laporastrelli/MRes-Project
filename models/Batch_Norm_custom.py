        An implementation of a Batch Normalization over a mini-batch of 2D inputs.

        The mean and standard-deviation are calculated per-dimension over the
        mini-batches and gamma and beta are learnable parameter vectors of
        size num_features.

        Parameters:
        - num_features: C from an expected input of size (N, C, H, W).
        - eps: a value added to the denominator for numerical stability. Default: 1e-5
        - momentum: momentum â€“ the value used for the running_mean and running_var
        computation. Default: 0.1
        - gamma: the learnable weights of shape (num_features).
        - beta: the learnable bias of the module of shape (num_features).
